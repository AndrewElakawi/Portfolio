# Portfolio
The following repository is a repository for both Andrew Elakawi and Georgia Ayoub to showcase their coding skillset.

## Languages Currently in Use
- Python

## Projects

### Project 1: Satellite Tracker
- Show a list of currently orbiting satellites, or pick one to "track."
- You could use a public API to fetch real-time satellite data (e.g., N2YO.com).
- As a a beginner, we can start by just displaying satellite names and simple info, not real-time orbits.

#### How Will it Work?
- Let the user enter the name (or ID) of a satellite
- Fetch basic data about that satellite from a public API (like name, launch date, contry, etc)
- Optionally: list currently popular satellites to choose from
- Display that information in the console

#### Stretch Goals
- Show the satellite's current position (latitude, longitude, altitude)
- Display all satellites currently above a certain location
- Save favourite satellites to a file for easy lookup
Add a simple menu for the user

### Project 2: (Georgia's project)
